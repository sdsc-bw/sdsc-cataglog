description: "Skater is a unified framework to enable Model Interpretation for all forms of model to help one build an Interpretable machine learning system often needed for real world use-cases (** we are actively working towards to enabling faithful interpretability for all forms models). It is an open source python library designed to demystify the learned structures of a black box model both globally (inference on the basis of a complete data set) and locally (inference about an individual prediction). The project was started as a research idea to find ways to enable better interpretability (preferably human interpretability) to predictive "black boxes" both for researchers and practitioners. The project is still in beta phase."
